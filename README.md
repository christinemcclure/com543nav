From to do:
Home page concept of a grid of the 50 wards that will function as navigation into more detailed ward pages. (Think 5×10 or 10×5 table where each ward is a table cell featuring a slice of photo of chicago/chicago neighborhood. 

When mouse hovers over table cell, image slice animates (flips) or image is replaced with text of “Ward 1: Neighborhood name.” Contact David or Khalila for more detailed description.)
